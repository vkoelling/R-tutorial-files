##### These files are R tutorial files that I have created for use by students in my classes and for those doing research with me. These tutorials cover basic statistical analyses and plotting. They are derived from lessons in this book:

Beckerman, A.P., Childs, D.Z., and Petchey, O.L. 2017. Getting Started with R: an Introduction for Biologists. 2nd edition. Oxford University Press. Oxford, UK.

##### The example datasets used in the tutorials came with the text and are not posted here. They can be obtained at:
